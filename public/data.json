    "description": "Rhaphidophora tetrasperma can be hard to come by, but lucky you, we know where to find them. This fast growing plant is often called &quot;Monstera Minima&quot; or &quot;Ginny Philo&quot; and is a highly sought after botanical prize. Its fenestrated leaves bear a resemblance to Monstera Deliciosa as these leaves have a somewhat similar split to them, but unlike Monstera the leaves stay fairly small, making it an excellent long-term roommate. This plant is very easy to care for and has a climbing, vining habit so over time it will need a pole, trellis, or wall to support its growth. ",

    "description": "Rebutia violaciflora is another lovely variety that features golden yellow spines that grow 25 mm long and a yellow-green, clump-forming, globular body. It carries large, funnel-shaped, light-violet blossoms in the early spring. Rebutia violaciflora is one of the morphological or local forms of Rebutia minuscula, but the differences are in reality very minimal and the two plants are not readily distinguishable, if not flowering. More likely they are one and the same species, but it still has a value for a collector because they identify plants with particular characters.",

Itâ€™s important to be aware that these plants are hard to grow, and if you are relatively new to plant care, they may not be the best option for you. They are pretty expensive and often prove easy to kill. Most people grow Trachyandra Tortilis / Albuca Namaquensis indoors, because it is a succulent and needs stable, warm temperatures. ",
